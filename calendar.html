            <h2>Facts You Need To Know About Rome</h2>
            <div class="wrapper">
            <button class="accordion1">Summer Heat Temperatures</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Everyone knows that the weather in Italy is 
                just fantastic, and especially during summer, a rainfall or storm is highly unlikely.
                But what you should know is that summers are really hot and humid.  The temperatures
                during the day can reach 40Â°C and August is the hottest month.  It is best not to walk 
                around during peak hours, like from 1pm to 4pm.  Nights are not as hot, but extremely humid. </p><br>
            </div>
            
            <button class="accordion2">Pick-pocketers in the City</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Unfortunately like all cities, Rome has a really bad 
                problem with theft, especially with the tourists.  Not a racist affirmation, but one has 
                to really be aware of a certain type of ethnicity in Rome, who are real pros when 
                it comes to robbery.  Tourists must just be aware of horribly dressed people 
                walking near you, and it is best not to keep your personal belongings in a backpack 
                because that is their specialty, backpacks.</p><br>
            </div>

            <button class="accordion3">Expensive Taxi Drivers</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <br>
                <p style="text-indent: 40px;">Not all taxi drivers are honest. Actually we can say 
                that probably 70% are going to end up to over charge your trip, so it is best to calculate your trip from 
                one point to another so you can get a better understanding of how long it would really 
                take.</p><br>
