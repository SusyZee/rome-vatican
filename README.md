Rome and Vatican tour Website
A demonstration of a website where you can book a trip together with a tour of both Rome and of the Vatican
Contains a form to fill, a JS slider, and a countdown timer
HTML, CSS and JavaScript used and Visual Studio Code
Other softwares mainly used for editing photos: Photoshop and Illustrator
All photos of inside and outside of the Vatican and of Rome, the Colosseum, the streets of Rome and background images
are all part of my personal photos and do not belong to anyone else, nor do they come from
a website, and neither from stock photos in the internet.
